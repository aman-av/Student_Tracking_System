Hostel management: The system can manage and monitor the allocation of rooms and bed spaces in the hostel, and track student check-ins and check-outs.

Location tracking: The system can use GPS or other location tracking technologies to monitor the movement of students within the campus and hostel, ensuring their safety and security.

Student information management: The system can store and manage student information, including personal details, academic records, and disciplinary records.

Notifications and alerts: The system can send notifications and alerts to students, parents, and administrators in real-time, such as reminders for classes, deadlines for assignments, or updates on room allocations.

Reporting and analytics: The system can provide reports and analytics on various aspects of student activity, such as attendance, location, and disciplinary records, to help administrators make informed decisions.

By offering these features, a student tracking system in a campus and hostel can provide a comprehensive and efficient way of managing student activity, improving student safety, and facilitating communication between administrators, teachers, and students.
